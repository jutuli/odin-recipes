    <p>
      For the sauce, heat Â½ cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven or kettle over
      low heat. Add the onions, minced garlic and pancetta, and cook, stirring,
      for 10 minutes, until the onions are wilted. Season liberally with salt
      and pepper. Raise heat slightly, add the wine and cook until it is mostly
      reduced, about 20 minutes. Crush the tomatoes into the pan, and add their
      juice. Add the tomato paste and 2 cups lukewarm water. Simmer for 1 hour.

      Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl. Chop the parsley
      with the whole garlic until fine, then stir into the beef mixture. Season
      lavishly with salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix until all the
      ingredients are well blended. Shape into meatballs and set aside.
